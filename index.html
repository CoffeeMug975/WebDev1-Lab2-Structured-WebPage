    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Here is yet another Korean fried chicken recipe that we<br>
        made recently with a sweet & spicy glaze. We have been<br>
        yearning for sometimes hot and spicy and we finally got<br>
        it. The extra heat came from using Thai chili pepers(aka<br>
        Bird's eye chili peppers) that we found at the local Asian<br>
        market. These cute, little peppers are quite deceiving,<br>
        measuring anywhere between 25'000 to 50'000 in<br>
        Scoville Units.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>24 chicken wings, cut into 3 pieces and tips discarded</li>
        <li>canola oil, for frying (peanut oil if avaliable)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (or garlic powder)</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3,4 Thai chili pepers, deseeded and finely minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1,2 tbp rice vinegar(or cider vinegar)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 cups cornstarch(1 cup coating, 1 cup for batter)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt and pepper</li>
        <li>sesame seeds (garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Preperation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut and discard the end tip of each chicken wing. cut remaining<br>
            pieces in half at the joint to create 2 pieces. Rinse pieces under cold<br>
            water and set to dry for at least 10 minutes. In a heavy pot such as <br>
            a dutch oven, pour in canola or peanut oil to a depth of 3 inches.<br>
            Heat over medium-high for about 15 minutes or until ready for<br>
            frying.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, combine sauce ingredients of soy, vinegar,<br>
            sugar, honey, ketchup, sesameoil, Thai chili peppers, and the<br>
            seasoning in a small sauce pan. Boil until sauce slightly thickens<br>
            and then set at low heat. Adjust the spiciness/sweetness of the<br>
            sauce by adding more minced red peppers and/or sugar,<br>
            continuously tasting for desired result.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large mixing mowl, mix 1 cup cornstarch and salt and<br>
            pepper. Individually coat each chicken wing pieces with the<br>
            cornstarch and set aside.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            In anothe bowl, whisk the remaining cornstarch and water<br>
            together to make a runny, liquid batter. Add each chicken wing<br>
            one at a time and coat well. Shake off excess batter and fry the<br>
            chicken in batches for about 10~13 minutes, or until golden brown,<br>
            then drain on paper towels. Do not overcrowd the pan when frying<br>
            each batch.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Flavor the wings with a brush or by tossing them all together in a<br>
            mixing bowl. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with sesame<br>
            seeds. Enjoy and eat while hot!<br><br>
